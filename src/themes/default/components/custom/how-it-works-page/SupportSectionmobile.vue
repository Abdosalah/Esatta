        Esatta believes that promoting and supporting independent designers is
        critical to a vibrant design community. Unfortunately, fashion design is a very
        competitive industry with high barriers to entry which stops many new
        designers.
      </p>
      <p class="mt-8">
        Independent designers who join Muute are provided with product
        development, manufacturing, marketing, sales, logistics and customer service
        support. In addition, they receive a percentage of profits from their styles.
      </p>
      <p class="mt-8">
        We believe this empowers them to focus on creating great designs and
        enable us to grow together.
